# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
npm ci
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Docs are deployed automatically to **GitHub Pages** via **GitHub Actions** (see `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml`).

To publish, just push to `main`.
