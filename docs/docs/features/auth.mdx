# Auth

MobileStack integrates with the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth) API to provide authentication services.

The `AuthProvider` currently supports signing in with email and password and anonymously.

To sign up with email and password provide the `SignUpUseCase` to the component constructor and use the operator function or anonymously function:

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val signUp: SignUpUseCase
): Component {
    fun onSignUp(email: String, password: String) {
        signUp(email, password)
    }

    fun onSignUpAnonymously() {
        signUp.anonymously()
    }
}
```

To sign in with email and password provide the `SignInUseCase` to the component constructor and use the operator function:

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val signIn: SignInUseCase
): Component {
    fun onSignIn(email: String, password: String) {
        signIn(email, password)
    }
}
```

To sign out provide the `SignOutUseCase` to the component constructor and use the operator function:

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val signOut: SignOutUseCase
): Component {
    fun onSignOut() {
        signOut()
    }
}
```

To delete the user provide the `DeleteAccountUseCase` to the component constructor and use the operator function:

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val deleteAccount: DeleteAccountUseCase
): Component {
    fun onDeleteAccount() {
        deleteAccount()
    }
}
```

To reset the password provide the `AuthProvider` to the component constructor and use the `resetPassword` function:

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val authProvider: AuthProvider
): Component {
    fun onResetPassword(email: String) {
        authProvider.resetPassword(email)
    }
}
```
