# Camera

MobileStack includes a camera library that allows you to take photos with the device's camera from Compose Multiplatform.

In order to use the camera, you need to include the `Camera` composable view in your screen.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen(component: MyComponent) {
   Camera(
        onCapture = component::onImageSelected,
        onSelectedFromFile = component::onImageSelected,
        onCloseTap = component::onCloseCameraTap,
        onRequestPermissionTap = component::onRequestCameraPermissionTap
    )
}
```

::: tip

You can check a full example of how to use the camera in the `AiSampleHomeScreen.kt` and `AiSampleComponent.kt` files in the [repository](https://github.com/GetMobileStack/mobilestack-kmp/blob/main/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/zenithapps/mobilestack/ui/screen/home/SampleAiHomeScreen.kt).
