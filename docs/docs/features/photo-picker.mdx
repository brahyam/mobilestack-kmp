# Photo Picker

MobileStack includes a photo picker that allows you to select photos from the device's photo library from Compose Multiplatform.

In order to use the photo picker, you need to include the `PhotoPicker` composable view in your screen.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen(component: MyComponent) {

    val singleImagePicker = rememberImagePickerLauncher(
        selectionMode = SelectionMode.Single,
        scope = scope,
        resizeOptions = pickerResizeOptions,
        onResult = { byteArrays ->
            byteArrays.firstOrNull()?.let {
                component.onSelectedFromFile(it)
            }
        }
    )

    Button(onClick = { singleImagePicker.launch() }) {
        Text("Select Image")
    }
}
```
