# Analytics

MobileStack integrates with the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics) API to provide analytics services including crashlytics.

The `AnalyticsProvider` currently supports logging events together with a screen name and custom attributes.

To log an event provide the `AnalyticsProvider` to the component constructor and use the `logEvent` function:

```kotlin
logEvent(name: String, screen: String? = null, attributes: Map<String, String>? = null)
```

eg. Logging a login event with a screen name and a custom attribute:

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val analyticsProvider: AnalyticsProvider
): Component {
    fun onPackageSelected(packageId: String) {
        analyticsProvider.logEvent("package_selected", "HomeScreen", mapOf("package_id" to packageId))
    }
}
```

You can check the logged events in the Firebase Console under Analytics / Events.
