# AI

MobileStack integrates with the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) API to provide AI services.

The `AiProvider` currently supports chat completions with and without images. 

Some use cases that you could implement with this are:

- Chat with any text content
- Identify elements in an image
- Describe an image
- Compare two images

In order to use the AI services, you need to:
- Add your OpenAI API key to Firebase Remote Config with the key `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Update the system prompt in `OpenAiProvider`
- Pass the `AiProvider` to the component constructor
- Use the function `completeTextChat` to get a chat completion
eg.

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val aiProvider: AiProvider
): Component {
    fun onCompleteTextChat() {
        val completion = aiProvider.completeTextChat("Hello, how are you?")
    }
}
```

:::danger
Always use a reverse proxy on production to avoid exposing your OpenAI API key. 

We recommend using a service like [Gateway](https://meetgateway.com).
