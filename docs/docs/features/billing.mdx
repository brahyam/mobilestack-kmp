# Billing

MobileStack uses RevenueCat for billing.

The recommended way to allow purchases is to use RevenueCat's remote paywall.

Whenever you would like to show a paywall, you can navigate to the `RemotePaywall` component.

You can also use the `BillingProvider` to get the current subscription status.

To access the current subscription status, you can pass the `BillingProvider` to the component constructor and use the `getCustomerBillingInfo` function:

```kotlin
class MyComponent(
    private val billingProvider: BillingProvider
): Component {
    private val scope = createCoroutineScope()

    fun onCurrentSubscriptionStatus() {
        scope.launch {
            val billingInfo = billingProvider.getCustomerBillingInfo()
            // billingInfo.entitlements contains the active user subscriptions
        }
    }
}
```
