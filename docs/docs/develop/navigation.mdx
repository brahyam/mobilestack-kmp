# Navigation

Navigation between components is handled by the Root Component and works as a stack of components.

When a component needs to navigate to another component, it emits an `Output` event to the parent component. The parent component then calls the `navigation.pushToFront(componentConfig: Config)` function with the target component Config.

When a component is configured in root, a function is provided to handle the `Output` events. This function is responsible for handling the `Output` events of the component and calling the `navigation` functions to navigate between components.

```kotlin
Config.Profile -> Child.Profile(
                component = DefaultProfileComponent(
                    componentContext = componentContext,
                    ...
                    onOutput = { output ->
                        when (output) {
                            ProfileComponent.Output.Purchase -> navigation.pushToFront(Config.RemotePaywall)
                            ProfileComponent.Output.GoBack -> navigation.pop()
                            ProfileComponent.Output.SignedOut -> navigation.replaceAll(Config.Welcome)
                        }
                    }
                )
            )
```
