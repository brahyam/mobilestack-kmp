# Components

Components are the building blocks of the app and are located in the shared module.

Each component is responsible for a single screen or a part of it.

They are represented by an interface that defines:
- Model: any dynamic data that the component needs to show to the user. eg. `ProfileComponent` needs to load a `User` to display the user's email.
- View Actions: functions that the view can call to notify the component about the user actions. eg. `ProfileComponent` can call `onSignOutTap()` to notify that the user clicked on the logout button.
- Outputs: events that the component can emit to it's parent component to notify of events that need to be handled outside of the component. eg. `ProfileComponent` can emit `SignedOut` to notify that the user logged out.

```kotlin

interface ProfileComponent {
    val model: Value<Model>

    data class Model(
        val initialLoading: Boolean = true,
        val loading: Boolean = false,
        val user: User? = null,
        val customerBillingInfo: CustomerBillingInfo? = null,
        val appVersion: String = "",
        val newEmail: String = "",
        val editModeEnabled: Boolean = false,
        val isAnonymous: Boolean = false,
        val canGoBack: Boolean
    )

    fun onSignOutTap()

    fun onPurchaseTap()

    fun onMarketingConsentChanged(consent: Boolean)

    fun onManagePurchasesTap()

    fun onRestorePurchasesTap()

    fun onHelpTap()

    fun onPrivacyPolicyTap()

    fun onTermsOfServiceTap()

    fun onOpenSourceLibrariesTap()

    fun onEmailChanged(email: String)

    fun onSaveEmailTap()

    fun onDeleteAccountTap()

    sealed interface Output {
        data object Purchase : Output
        data object SignedOut : Output
        data object GoBack : Output
    }
}
```
